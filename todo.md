# TODO:
- [ ] add a way to resign/restart
- [ ] add checkmate indication
- [ ] add move history
- [ ] Three fulled repetition feels like 5-fulled repetition // stockfish repeated 4 times, look into it
- [ ] the board feels a little moved to the left, as if math was random, guessed, not counted
- [x] misplaced queens and kings // castles work just on different sides, looks like we are placing them mirrored
- [x] camera should rotate around the board, not all the way around
- [x] camera should be facing the white pieces from behind, not from the front
