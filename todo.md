- [ ] ask what to promote to
- [x] Let the player choose the difficulty // How ??  ChatGPT --> The fact that you're losing to Stockfish even at depth 1 is completely normal â€” even at its lowest depth, it's

- [x] Three fulled repetition not working // stockfish repeats infinitely
- [x] add a way to resign/restart
- [x] add option to play as black
- [x] remove yellow ring after drag and drop move
- [x] right click to remove highlights of possible moves // also highlight right-clicked square // maybe would highligh only when not removing selection
- [x] change background to be less dark, black pieces are hard to see sometimes
